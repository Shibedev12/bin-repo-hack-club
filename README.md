# My Alarm System From The Bin!
## Developed By Shibedev12 For Hack Club's The Bin!
### How it works:
### 1. The RPI Pico W starts up and arms itself after 2 seconds.
### 2. A looping Armed... Message plays until the motion sensor reports that motion is detected.
### 3. The speaker blares for 5 seconds while the display says INTRUDER!!!
### Its That Easy! Just Plug It In And Go!

## The Wiring
### It's not all too crazy, take a look at the image below!
![The wiring diagram](https://github.com/Shibedev12/bin-repo-hack-club/blob/main/wiringdiagram.png?raw=true)
### As you can see, red wires carry voltage, black wires carry ground, and brown lines carry data!
### Not to crazy, just functional!
